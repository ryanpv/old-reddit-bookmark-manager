1. Implement mongodb
2. Attach firebase auth to db
3. Create page for ALL (unsorted) reddit bookmarks
4. Fetch all reddit bookmarks
5. Radio buttons for each bookmark to "move to" category?



Input in sidebar should have it's own state. on submit it will fetch to the POST endpoint. There should be a function that fetches the GET endpoint
to list the categories on the sidebar. This will clean up the code a bit

fetch is run on initial render with useEffect. It should be done after login??? Refactor code to
have it render after login instead

each fetch request, if middleware is run on every route, must also pass token to be validated. determine which requests
require this

post object with users uid/unique identifier 
on requests, check if query's req.${id} matches the one in posted db object
